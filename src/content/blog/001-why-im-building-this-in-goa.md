I’m building a walking-first fitness app because most trackers feel like running apps with walking bolted on.

Right now I’m testing it in Goa with two long walks a day. That gives me real-world data fast:
- GPS accuracy on beaches vs roads
- battery drain in heat
- pace stability on long steady walks
- how “clean” a route looks when GPS drops out

This blog is a public lab notebook: what I’m building, what I’m learning, and what I’m changing as the app improves.
